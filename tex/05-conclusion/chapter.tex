\chapter{Conclusion}

This project has successfully demonstrated that networks of recurrently connected
spiking neurons are able to learn to generate monophonic melodies in the
symbolic domain. Through the inclusion of neuronal adaptation, such networks
approach the sequence modelling capabilities of LSTMs. As expected, the
musicality of generated melodies is rather mediocre, but the significance of
these findings is more fundamental than that. It is remarkable, and perhaps
magical, that a computer simulation of an intricate biological structure
produces melodies which, at the very least, make sense.
