\chapter{Implementation}

Having laid out all the prerequisite concepts in the previous chapter, let's now
recap what comprises the scope of this project. The model shall build on Basic
RNN, an LSTM-based model from Magenta. The aim is to create a variant that
instead uses an LSNN. After acquiring and preprocessing MIDI files, the
resulting dataset shall be used to train and evaluate equivalent configurations
of both models. Finally, it will be possible to generate melodies and to assess
their musicality.

\subsubsection{Software}
The code for this project is written in Python 3. It uses TensorFlow, an
open-source machine learning library. This was an obvious choice, as TensorFlow
is used by both Magenta and several relevant SNN research papers
\cite{Bellec2018LSNN, Bellec2020}.
