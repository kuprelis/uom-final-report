\chapter{Evaluation}

In this chapter, the implemented model is analysed in terms of training time,
classification accuracy, and musicality of generated melodies. The seminal
research paper on LSNNs \cite{Bellec2018LSNN} shows that LSNNs exhibit learning
capabilities similar to that of LSTMs, therefore comparisons shall be carried
out against a baseline LSTM model trained on the same dataset.
