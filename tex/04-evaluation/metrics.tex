In each step, the model chooses one of 38 possible events. This means that
random guessing would give an overall accuracy of \(\frac{1}{38} \approx 3\%\).
However, the model is quick to learn that \emph{no-event} is by far the most
common label in the dataset, leading to a rapid increase in \emph{no-event
accuracy} (figure \ref{fig:initial-accuracy}). This can give a false impression
of good performance -- in reality, the model still has no ability to predict
notes correctly.

In order to avoid the issue explained above, all experiments were evaluated
according to the single metric of \emph{event accuracy}. More precisely, this is
the percentage of correct predictions in positions whose ground truth label is
\emph{note-off} or any of the 36 \emph{note-on} events.

For LSNNs, it is also interesting to keep track of the average neuron firing
rate. Firing rate regularisation was applied in all performed experiments, and
the network was able to converge to the target rate (figure
\ref{fig:firing-rate}). Overall, this means that the model learns to represent
information using a temporal coding. This is especially important on
neuromorphic hardware such as SpiNNaker \cite{Furber2014}, where a reduction in
firing rate leads to reduced energy consumption.
