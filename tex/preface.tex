\section*{Abstract}

This project investigates the sequence modelling capabilities of spiking neural
networks (SNNs), specifically in the context of monophonic melodies. We find
that certain types of SNNs are able to approximate the accuracy of simple LSTM
models, even under several biological constraints. On the other hand, training a
spiking network on commodity hardware remains relatively impractical, and we
explore potential solutions to this problem. Furthermore, the SNN model suffers
from similar issues as an LSTM, such as the lack of long-term cohesion in
generated melodies.

\section*{Acknowledgements}

First and foremost, I would like to express sincere gratitude to my supervisor,
Prof. Steve Furber, for his continued support over the last 6 months. It has
been a pleasure and an honour to work with someone so knowledgeable and
passionate about their field.

Next, I am thankful to Mr. Adam Perrett and Dr. Andrew Gait from the APT
research group, for guidance during the initial stages of the project. Their
insights were very helpful in making key implementation decisions.

Last but not least, I am endlessly grateful to my parents for enabling me to
study abroad. The past three years at the University of Manchester have been a
life-changing experience, one which would have not been possible without their
support.
